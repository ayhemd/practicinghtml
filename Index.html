      <h1> About me</h1> 
      <p>
        I have a strong passion for learning and personal development, with a
         particular interest in health, science, and technology. 
        In my free time, I enjoy engaging in hobbies like reading, traveling, and 
        exploring new cultures. I'm also keen on outdoor activities and staying 
        active. Professionally, I am always eager to take on new challenges that
         allow me to expand my skill set and contribute meaningfully to any team 
         I am part of.

        <h1>Why did i choose web devloppment?</h1>
        <p> I decided to join a web development boot camp because I've always 
          been passionate about technology and problem-solving. I realized 
          that web development is a powerful way to combine creativity with 
          logic, and I wanted to turn this passion into a tangible skill set.
           This boot camp is a crucial step in my journey to not only learn 
           but to challenge myself and grow. I'm highly motivated to develop 
           real-world solutions, and I see this as an opportunity to build a 
           strong foundation for a long-term career in tech. 
           My ambition drives me to keep pushing boundaries, and I'm eager to
            bring that energy to my next role.</p>
